Some first attempts at defining functions and graphing with multipolar numbers and Javascript such that the complex hexapolar number system was the initial focus. Subsequent generalization to finite multipolar systems of any natural p, and then to arbitrary precision.
Then generalized to infinite multipolar systems in which the set of values of p may have the cardinality of the continuum.
